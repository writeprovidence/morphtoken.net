# MorphToken
A non-fungible token to serve as a standalone collectable and also as a backbone for other non-fungible projects and assets.

## Goals
1. Make is easier for people to launch collectable games and other projects that rely on non-fungible assets.
2. Provide a fungible token to serve as "packs" of MorphTokens. Similar to how trading cards come in a pack which is undistinguishable from other packs, yet the cards within are all unique.
3. Provide a non-fungible token with several fields of varying types of data attached to each token. (MorphToken)
4. Provide an algorithm that is acceptably random for generating new MorphTokens.

## Why
Since the success of Cryptokitties, dozens of non-fungible token (NFT) projects have been launched.
