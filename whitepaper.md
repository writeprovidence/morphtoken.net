# MorphToken
A non-fungible token to serve as a standalone collectable and also as a backbone for other non-fungible projects and assets.

## Goals
1. Make is easier for people to launch collectable games and other projects that rely on non-fungible assets.
2. Provide a fungible token to serve as "packs" of MorphTokens. Similar to how trading cards come in a pack which is undistinguishable from other packs, yet the cards within are all unique.
3. Provide a non-fungible token with several fields of varying types of data attached to each token. (MorphToken)
4. Provide an algorithm that is acceptably random for generating new MorphTokens.

## Why
Since the success of Cryptokitties, dozens of non-fungible token (NFT) projects have been launched.

## Definitions of Terms Used Here
- Fungible: An asset which is interchangeable with other assets of the same kind. For example, a dollar.  It doesn't matter which dollar it is, you can use any dollar to buy things in a store.
- Non-fungible: An asset which is _not_ interchangeable. For example, a baseball card.  All the cards in a set are unique and have different attributes, even though they are all baseball cards.
